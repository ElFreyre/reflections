The pros is that I have all the control and that's also a cons haha, in the way that I have the control
I can be a mess with my commits and that's bad for the project and myself

while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Bc in this case a big project is not only 1 file, it is involve with a lot of files most of the time
so it's easy to understand why they do that

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
With git log I can view the note that the developer put, and his id and with git diff I can compare the two Ids that I want

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
If i screw up something, i just need to comeback to a safe commit/head and work with that

For working  th my coworkers or friends
